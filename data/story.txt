BUMBLYBURG -- The Bumblyburg town council voted 4-3 Tuesday night to allow a developer to build a five-story hotel in the town's historic "Funtown" district, over the objections of residents who said the project will add to parking and noise woes in the area.
The Bumblyburg Tourism Advisory Group, which had strongly backed the move, called the approval a long-overdue boost for the town's economy.
